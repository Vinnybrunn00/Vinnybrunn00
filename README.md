## Hello, I'm Vinícius Bruno!

I'm a **Flutter developer** and **IT professional**, driven by curiosity and a genuine desire to build things that are truly useful. I work on creating apps, APIs, and automations, and I also handle maintenance, support, and system deployment when needed. I enjoy turning ideas into something real—something that works, helps people, and helps me grow as a developer.

I'm currently focused on improving my skills by studying:

- Architecture and best practices (Clean, Modular, MVVM)
- State management (Provider)
- Building REST APIs with Python and Node.js
- Optimization and animations in Flutter
- Design patterns

I believe technology is about **solving problems**, not just writing code.
